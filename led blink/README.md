# Led blink

I will start with the simplets task there is: Turning a LED on and off using a timer. 
Datasheet information can be found here:

## Tasks

* Configure the Arduino using its registers.
    * Setup the LED13 (this one is included on the board so we don't need extra hardware) as an output.
    * Turn on/off the LED13 for 0.5s each. This will be used with the included timer. We will leave the
        timer configuration and interrupt for a later time.

## Goals

* Learn to understand a datasheet.
* Learn how to configure registers using the datasheet information.
