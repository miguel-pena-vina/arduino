# Arduino
This project is to show how to work with a microcontroller. We will be using an Arduino UNO boards, based on the ATmega328P chip.

## Goals

The project will show how to use the most important characteristics of the Arduino. However, I will not be using external libraries. All the drivers
will be programmed by me in order to show how it works.

### Configuration
* Undestand the datasheet information and how are registers accessed.
* Configure the system writing to the necessary registers.

### Communication protocols
* Understand the most common protocols used with microcontrolers:
    * CAN, SPI, I2C, USART
    * AHB, APB, Bus Protocol

### Interrupts
* Correctly setup interrupts.
* Work with the MCU counters and timers.
* Different types of MCU clock sources: HCLK, PCLK, PLL

### Peripherals:
* IRQ, Vector table and NVIC
* Develop APIs for common peripherals such as : Encoders, LCDs, Audio devices and signal processing.
